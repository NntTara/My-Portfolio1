                You can call me " Nint " I was born on December 12, 2005. Now that I'm 17, I study at Suankularbwittayalai Thonburi, grade 12.</p>
            <p class="pt">
                Actually, I like to practice my coding skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Yeah, it's my hobby, but I also have other hobbies. Playing guitar, manga, or anime, sometimes I played online games with my friends, but not too much.</p>
            <p class="pt">
                
                Special abilities: I think I'm a person who learns new things quickly. If it's something I like, I'll put a lot of effort into it. It took me no more than a week to learn HTML, and I was able to understand and do it myself and think outside the box in my writing. Another highlight is my skills in playing the guitar and piano. I have been learning the guitar since I was a child. My skills are now very developed.
